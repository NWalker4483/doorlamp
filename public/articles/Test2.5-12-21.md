    The structure of the internet has changed a lot in the past decade or
    two. In the '90s and early 2000's, centralized platforms that acted as
    people's sole windows into the web weren't nearly as common as they
    are now. Today, most people only visit a handful of websites, typically
    mediated by a phone app. When someone wants to host their own
    content online, they make profiles with big platforms, never really
    owning their own stage. This platform dependency caught my eye
    because of how strongly it contrast with the online experience of two
    decades ago. Users would bounce around between websites like tiny
    islands completely independent of each other. One of the most
    notable islands of those old days, the personal blog, has all
    but disappeared in favor of social media pages. At least that's what I
    thought until bringing up the topic to some of my friends on Discord.
    The line between social media platforms like Tumblr and old-school
    blogs is honestly quite blurry. After a few tangents, I needed to
    reexamine the way I look at those internet islands. Especially the
    connective tissue that binds users together online.

    Tumblr occupies a strange space for me on its... blogginess? Tumblr
    allows its users to create personal pages called blogs. Users can post
    text, videos, and images to their blog, as well as reblog other user's
    content to their page. Blogs still do a lot of the things that old-school
    blogs did for their owners; host a platform for their users' personal
    interests. From what I remember, users can even import HTML and
    javascript to customize their layouts. It's a unique platform to host a
    user's thoughts and ideas, but it's deeply nested inside the rest of
    Tumblr.

    Every blog on Tumblr is tied together using the site's more social
    -media-esque functionalities. Users can search between blogs using
    tags and subscribe to them without ever leaving Tumblr. If users enjoy
    a post, they can like and reblog it to their own page. It's a closed
    system, unlike the old-school island-style blogs. Not only that, the
    content that they allow is strictly controlled by Tumblr corporate. The
    NFSW ban a few years ago affected everyone regardless of how
    personal they felt their blog was. Tumblr blogs are dependent on the
    approval and connective tissue of the Tumblr platform, unlike old-
    school blogs that are more isolated.

    An old-school blog hosted on an independent server has relatively few
    restrictions on what it can host, but I hesitate to say they are
    completely independent. It's not as if there isn't any connective tissue
    between blogs, it's just different. In order for any kind of blog to be
    successful, people need to be able to find it. On Tumblr, that happens
    through tags and reblogs, on old-school blogs, it's through search
    engines or word of mouth. There are two other major differences that
    divide the two kinds of blogs for me.

    First, is the ability to gain success off of outrage. For example, on
    Twitter the other day, there was a post about Shrek's 20th anniversary.
    Someone had written an article about how it wasn't as good as people
    remember or something like that. I'm not saying that it's not
    impossible for someone to dislike Shrek, I'm saying that it's hard for
    me to believe that this article wasn't written to be intentionally
    contrarian to get clicks and retweets. Every other day there's a story
    about a TikToker making a really gross meal or something outrageous
    like that. It's tiring. These platforms don't distinguish between positive
    and negative engagement.

    Second is the competitive aspects of social media. Writing here feels
    less like posting to a platform and more like writing in a journal. What
    is here isn't tossed out into the content void to mix in with everyone
    else's posts. It's just here in uncompetitive isolation. There are no
    points to win. This is my platform and I can post whatever I want.
    I feel like I've lost my focus a bit. Sometimes the constant internet
    frenzy starts to wear on me. I guess I just wish the world was smaller.
    I'm tired of being tied to my phone constantly. It still doesn't help me 
    figure out whether or not Tumblr is a blog, but I'm not sure I was even 
    approaching the question correctly. If people experience Tumblr as a 
    blog then it's a blog or at least a kind of blog. The way things have 
    been
    framed here almost reads as if I'm trying to say that old-school blogs 
    are "better" than Tumblr blogs, but I think it's more accurate to say they 
    serve different purposes. A Tumblr blog functions more like other 
    social media platforms which is good for people that want to reach a 
    wider audience. An old-school blog is more like a journal. It has a much 
    lower chance of taking off but puts a bit less pressure on the owner. 
    Binary categories, even with questions as trivial as "is or isn't a blog", 
    rarely do enough to explain every aspect of the problems they tackle. 
    Blog is just another category that can be useful sometimes but 
    shouldn't be used as a hard line when it serves no purpose. There are 
    always exceptions to any category. Like most of the essays that I end 
    up writing, the only solid conclusion I can settle on is that things are 
    things and words don't always cut it. Even still, I think there is lots of 
    value in cracking open an HTML file, learning a bit of code, and 
    possibly publishing something even if it's just for the experience.
